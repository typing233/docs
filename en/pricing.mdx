# Pricing

Scenext API uses a credit-based billing model, pay-as-you-go.

## Billing Model

### Scene-based Billing

- **Basic Unit**: Scene
- **Cost**: Each scene consumes **2 credits**
- **Calculation**: The system automatically generates storyboard scripts based on your content, and the number of scenes in the final video is the billing basis

### Example

Suppose you submit content and the system generates a video with 8 scenes:
- Scene count: 8
- Credits consumed: 8 Ã— 2 = 16 credits

## Getting Credits
